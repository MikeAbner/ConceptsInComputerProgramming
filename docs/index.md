# Introduction

Concepts In Computer Programming aims to be a complete curriculum for
learning how to build full featured applications from the ground up. We'll start at the "very beginning" and meander through all of the important topics necessary to understand and build computer programs effectively.  This is very much a work in progress and is intended to be used as a "virtual classroom", so please use the [Issues](https://github.com/MikeAbner/ConceptsInComputerProgramming/issues) tab of the repository to ask any question you have and to provide answers where you can.
